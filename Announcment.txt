A new release of the "B7094" IBM 7094 emulator (previously hosted at https://www.fosshub.com/B7094-IBM7094-Emulator.html) is now available on GitHub at https://github.com/Bertoid1311/B7094/.

This new version, as well as fixing some long-standing bugs in the user interface, has some new capabilities in the emulation itself.

There is a README.md file on the GitHub page that gives all the particulars.

Enjoy!
