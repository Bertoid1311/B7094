# Change Log

Enhancements in the new Version 3.4A release:

Fixed some long-standing bugs in the user interface.  (E.g.,
the Editor now allows you to actually save files.)
The script interpreter has been enhanced to support some of
the new capabilities mentioned below.

The Tape Viewer has been thoroughly re-worked:

The hexadecimal column in the binary-mode display has been eliminated.
Since this is a 36-bit, 6-bit byte machine -- with each byte,
or character, interpretable as two 3-bit octal digits -- displaying
a single machine word as 12 octal digits (or 6 BCD characters) makes
perfect sense, whereas displaying a 36-bit word as 9 4-bit hexadecimal
digits (where one hex digit is only 2/3 of a byte, but two hex digits
is 1 1/3 bytes) makes no sense at all.  The 12-digit hexadecimal column
in the old Tape Viewer was actually showing the raw P7B tape image
data (which stores a 6-bit 7094 byte in an 8-bit byte in the tape image);
but this was confusing, particularly as it was inconsistent with the
9-digit hexadecimal displays that can be toggled elsewhere in
the emulator (such as on the console).  Also it was not immediately
obvious why the digits in the hex Tape Viewer column could
sometimes be the same and other times be different from their octal
counterparts (such as when a parity bit was on or a start-of-record
bit was on in a P7B byte).  Examining the underlying format of a tape image
is best left to external tools, rather than having it bleed, confusingly,
into the emulator itself.  (Oct/Hex toggle buttons remain throughout the
emulator, however -- just ignore them.)

The Hex Data column has been replaced by a new character column showing
machine words interpreted as if they contain six characters using
internal BCD character codes, rather than the usual external BCD character
codes used on a BCD tape. This column always contains gibberish for a
"pure" BCD tape, but on a hybrid BCD and binary tape (such as a job tape
containing a program in relocatable binary form), or even on a "pure"
binary tape (such as an IBSYS tape), this column sometimes shows
human-readable text that can be of interest.

Implemented a "sliding window" for the Tape Viewer, where arbitrary
"From Byte" and "To Byte" positions can be selected for display.
The "Redisplay" button causes the chosen limits to take effect
(if "From Byte" is blank, it defaults to 0; if "To Byte" is blank,
it defaults to either the last position on the tape or to "From Byte" plus
a maximum window size, whichever is lower). "Clear" clears "From Byte"
and "To Byte". "Use Whole Tape" resets the limits from 0 up to either the
actual size of the tape or the maximum window size, whichever is lower. The
maximum window size is large enough to be able to see all of SYSOUT.BCD for
all the demos without the user having to increase the "From Byte" and click
"Redisplay" to see the end of the tape. All the labels and buttons having
to do with the adjustable view window are colored purple, to visually group
them together.  The Tape Viewer resynchronizes the word framing when
starting the display from an arbitrary point on the tape.

The scripted demos have been expanded to allow choosing
between two alternative versions of IBSYS: the originally-included
two-tape ASYS1/ASYS8 system recovered by Paul Pierce a quarter-century
ago, and the single-tape "Aerojet-General" KSYS61 version
(also originally recovered by Paul Pierce).

Using the KSYS61 system, FORTRAN II now supports
"chaining", which allows the early-60s "Structural Engineering
System Solver" program (STRESS III, from MIT, originally
transcribed from a listing on bitsavers by Richard Cornwell and
later further proofread by others), to build and run to completion
with sample input data from the STRESS user's manual downloadable
from MIT.

Sample programs can now be run in relocatable binary form
(for FORTRAN II, in KSYS61 only; for IBJOB languages, in
either version of IBSYS).  Instructions (and Unix-y utilities)
for extracting a binary job from the "peripheral punch" tape
generated by the compiler, are provided in a separate "reloc_scripts"
archive.

The emulator demo scripts can be run either in "verbose"
mode, which provides lots of explanation and references; or
"silent" mode, which skips all the verbiage and just presents
straightforward option menus on the minimum number of click-through
screens.

The demos have been reorganized into more logical groups
by "subsystem" -- either FORTRAN II (which provides FORTRAN II
and the Fortran Assembly Program) or IBJOB (which provides
FORTRAN IV, COBOL, and a Macro Assembly Program).  A couple
of the utility demos from the earlier release have been retained: the
IBEDT editor used to maintain IBSYS itself (in the demo, used just
to copy and list the contents of a system tape), and
the IBJOB "Librarian" used to maintain the IBLIB subroutine
library (here just used to list and cross-reference the
contents of the library).  A couple of stand-alone diagnostic
programs -- one loaded from the card reader the other from
tape -- are still included (though neither one runs completely
error-free).

Description

B7094 is a software emulator for the IBM 7094 computer, a commercial 36-bit
(6-bit byte) "scientific" computer (with 15-bit addresses, encompassing 32K words)
that was produced (beginning as the model 7090; the 7094 was a slightly enhanced version)
starting in 1959, and withdrawn from sale in 1969.  While a few installations
(e.g., at MIT) remained in service into the 1970s, by the late 60s many customers
were switching over to the System/360 series (a 32-bit, 8-bit-byte architecture
touted as being "universally" applicable to both commercial and scientific tasks,
with a greatly expanded address space).  The 7094 was a member
of the "7000 series", which also included commercial machines such as
the 7070 and 7074 (architecturally dissimilar to the 7090 and 7094, but
sharing manufacturing technology and peripherals) and the quasi-experimental
7030 "STRETCH" supercomputer.  The 7090/7094 was preceded by the vacuum-tube
"700 series", an architecturally-similar line of 36-bit machines beginning
with the 704 in 1954 (on which both Fortran and Lisp were developed) up through
the 709 in 1958).  The machines introduced in 1959 featured IBM's first generation
of discrete-transistor circuitry.

While the machine supported random-access storage devices (disk and drum),
and some installations utilized these (e.g., MIT's CTSS timesharing system),
the more common "IBSYS" operating system made heavy use of magnetic tape and
punched cards.

This emulator has a graphical interface with separate windows for the
main console with all its flashing lights (though not a faithful recreation
of a 7094 in photo-realistic detail), the card reader, the line printer and
all the tape drives, as well as several other specialized windows.

B7094 can run two different preserved versions of the IBSYS operating system,
and can compile and execute programs written in FORTRAN II and the Fortran
Assembly Program (FAP) under the FORTRAN II subsystem; as well as FORTRAN IV,
COBOL, and a Macro Assembly Program (MAP) under the IBJOB subsystem.  All the
required 7094 software to do that is included in the distribution.

Note: B7094 is a Windows program, but it can be run (with only a few non-fatal
quirks) on Linux under Wine.  Both 32-bit and 64-bit executables are provided.
The 32-bit executable will still run on Windows XP, and both executables will
run on any 64-bit version of Windows from Vista up through the present.

To avoid needing the user to have any detailed knowledge of how these machines
and their software operated, the emulator provides some prepackaged demonstrations
that are easily managed and viewed, thanks to the emulator's built-in scripting
language.  Two "modes" of operation are provided: a "verbose" mode that displays
windows with a great deal of textual explanation as well as references to
other resources, and a "silent" mode that bypasses all the text (though
the clickable option lists on the demo screens are still self-explanatory).

Installing the emulator and running the demonstrations is extremely easy to do:

1. Download the distribution archive

2. Extract it into a new folder

3. Run either B7094.32.exe or B7094.64.exe in the created "Bin" sub-folder

4. Click on the options displayed to select from the many demonstrations available.

B7094 makes no changes to the Windows registry or any other part of the system
other than its install folder. Deleting the distribution archive and the install
folder will completely remove B704 from your system.

The source is included in the distribution, to allow you to compile and modify or
enhance the program.

There is a YouTube video that shows the use and operation of B7094 (an earlier
release, but the basic operation is the same), followed by another describing how
to compile B7094 from the sources. The video is available on YouTube
[ https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xaBS6pWrG0 ].

The second archive here (labelled "reloc_scripts") is a package containing bash
shell scripts and other supporting utilities (hence requiring a Unix-y
environment to run, either Linux or something like Msys or Cygwin under Windows)
that can process Peripheral Punch tapes generated by the IBSYS compilers
and extract and format the data required to create relocatable binary jobs (i.e.,
programs that can be re-run without recompiling them every time).  There
are instructions on how to do this in the included README.txt file.  But
note that this is provided for **advanced** users.  The relocatable jobs
in the demo scripts have already been processed with these tools.
