B7094 is a Windows-based emulator for the IBM 7094 mainframe computer from the 1960s.

## Basic usage

If you're a "casual" user, and running Windows, just:

- Download the B7094V34A.zip distribution archive

- Extract it into a new folder

- Run either B7094.32.exe or B7094.64.exe in the created "Bin" sub-folder

- Click on the options displayed to select from the many demonstrations available.

B7094 makes no changes to the Windows registry or any other part of the system other than its install folder. Deleting the distribution archive and the install folder will completely remove B704 from your system.

There is a YouTube video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xaBS6pWrG0) that shows the use and operation of B7094 (an earlier release, but the basic operation is the same).
